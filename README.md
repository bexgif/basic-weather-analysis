# basic-weather-analysis

##  Weather Analysis Project
### Overview
This project is focused on analysing weather data. The dataset includes various weather-related features, and the analysis process involves tasks such as renaming columns, splitting data, and other preprocessing steps. The goal of this project is to clean, transform, and explore the data for meaningful insights into weather patterns.

### Features
The main tasks completed in this project include:

Column Renaming: The original dataset contained a column with a vague title. This was renamed for better readability and understanding.

Column Splitting: A column was split to give them each more value and to make it more understandable.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries to improve data quality.

General commands: In this piece I demonstrated various different functions to show my ability.


### Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

date: The date of the weather observation.

time: The time of the weather observation.

temperature_in_celsius: The temperature recorded at a specific time.

dew_point_temperature_in_celsius: The temperature the air needed to be cooled at.

humidity: The humidity level recorded.

wind_speed: Speed of the wind.

visability: The visability.

pressure: The pressure level.

weather_type: Type of weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).


### Software / Tools
To create this project I used:

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook 

Pandas

NumPy
